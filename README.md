# ISEL_1516I_PDM51N

This is a personal repository with my samples, tests and other stuff that i consider important for my class of PDM 
(Programação em Dispositivos Móveis / Mobile Development ) at ISEL.

It is not intendend to be used as a project or a final product and it will show my learning process. 

Feel free to use at your own risk.
